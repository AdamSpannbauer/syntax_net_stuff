# Tutorial Models

This repository contains models referenced to from the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). We recommend installing TensorFlow from the [nightly builds](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#installation) rather than the r0.12 release before running these models.
